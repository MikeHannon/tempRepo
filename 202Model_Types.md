# Django Models

Lets cover a few common concepts about Django Models. The first being the structure of how we define the column types. The second being the different types a column can take on.

### Column Structure

Inside our model class:

``` python
from django.db import models
class ModelThing(models.Model):
   column_name = models.Column_Type(optional_params)

```

All we did was set the column to be saved as the type of whatever we specified, those options for the column type are listed below.

### Field options

##### AutoField
Dont worry about this field too much, this is created for we under the hood when it comes to the primary ID key.

##### CharField
This field is meant for any text that can be small to large that a user may enter


##### DateField
Only meant for date type that will be passed, can have optional parameters such as auto_now_add=True which adds the current date when the object is created

##### DateTimeField
Same concept as DateField, has optional parameters that can be passed in as well

##### DecimalField
Decimal styled field, with fixed precision. It can be passed a few different optional parameters such as max_digits and decimal_places

##### EmailField
A Char field that also runs the string that is inputed through a built in Email Validator

##### FileField
A file upload field, dont worry too much about it but cool to look into

##### IntegerField
A field specified to always be a integer, values are set to be within the range of -2147483648 to 2147483647

##### TextField
Same as CharField but can support longer text inputs, defaults as a text field when using the form widget

### Relationship Fields options

##### ForeignKey
A one-to-many relationship, we are required to pass the model we wish to link to as a parameter to the field. There are a range of cascading effects we can add as a parameter if needed such as on_delete.

##### ManyToManyField
A many-to-many relationship that requires a parameter of the model we wish to link to, same way the ForeignKey is structured. With this field option something happens behind the scenes, Django creates a many-to-many table that represents the joins between these two models. The name of the table is generated by combining the name of the many-to-many field with the model it is linked to.

##### OneToOneField
A one-to-one relationship, works the same way as the ForeignKey field in that it requires the model that will be linked to be passed in as a parameter. This field will only return one object when called.
