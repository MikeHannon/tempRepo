# Django Models
Lets cover a few common concepts about Django Models:
1. How we define the column types
2. The different types a column can take on

### Column Structure
Inside our model class:

``` python
from django.db import models
class ModelThing(models.Model):
#  column_name = models.Column_Type(optional_params)
  first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```

All we did was set the column (named `first_name`) to be saved as the type of whatever we specified (`CharField`), and provided an optional parameter (`max_length=30`).

### Column types

+ `AutoField`
  + Don't worry about this field too much; it's created for us automatically

+ `CharField`
  + Any text that can be small to large that a user may enter

+ `DateField`
  + Used for dates. Can have optional parameters such as `auto_now_add=True` which adds the current date when object is created

+ `DateTimeField`
  + Same concept as `DateField`, but has added optional parameters

+ `DecimalField`
  + Decimal styled field, with fixed precision. Can be passed a few optional parameters such as `max_digits` and `decimal_places`

+ `EmailField`
  + A *Char* field that also runs the inputted string through a built in *Email Validator*

+ `FileField`
  + A file upload field

+ `IntegerField`
  + A field specified to always be a integer; values are set to be within the range of `-2147483648` to `2147483647`

+ `TextField`
  + Same as `CharField` but can support longer text inputs; defaults as a text field when using the form widget

### Relationship options

`ForeignKey`
>A one-to-many relationship; we are required to pass the model we wish to link to as a parameter to the field. There are a range of cascading effects we can add as a parameter if needed, such as `on_delete`.

`ManyToManyField`
>A many-to-many relationship; requires a parameter of the model we wish to link to -- same as `ForeignKey`. With this field option, Django creates a many-to-many table that represents the joins between these two models. The name of the table is generated by combining the name of the many-to-many field with the model it is linked to.

`OneToOneField`
>A one-to-one relationship; same as the `ForeignKey` field in that it requires the model that will be linked to be passed in as a parameter. This field will only return one object when called.
