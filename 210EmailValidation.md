Good. Now:

+ Create an application that asks a user to enter an email address
+ If the email address is not valid, have a notification "Email is not valid!" display on the homepage

![email2](/emailvalidationassignment2.png "email2")

+ Once a valid email address is entered, save to the database the email address the user entered
+ On the success page, display all the email addresses entered, along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) of when each email record was created
+ **Bonus**: Allow the user to delete an email record on the success page
