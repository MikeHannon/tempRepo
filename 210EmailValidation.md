Once a valid email address is entered, save to the database the email address the user entered

On the success page, display all the email addresses entered along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) when the email addresses were entered

(Bonus) add a new feature that allows the user to delete an email record on the success page.
Your success page should look like this once done.
