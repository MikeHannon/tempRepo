# Assignment: Belt Reviewer

Again see the pylot chapter for a better view of this project -- sorry the image is so bad!

Like many assignments you've already completed, you'll be given a wireframe of a web application and asked to both create it (from database to front-end) and deploy it. For these exams, there's no need to worry about CSS styling. Any score above a 9.5 results in a black belt, while a score of between 8 and 9.5 yields a red belt.

The exam may be conducted during class if you're joining the on-site bootcamp. Generally, you take the exam through exams.codingdojo.com. The exam is timed and you'll have 4.5 hours to complete it. We have created a sample for you below. For the sample exam, you can take as much time as you want. Here are helpful tips to help you earn your belt.

Know that many of our black belt students had to take the belt exam twice or even three times!  These exams are NOT easy. We give these exams to those that apply to join CodingDojo staff as an instructor/consultant, many of whom have 5-7+ years of experience, and 70-80% of them completely fail the exam. Do NOT get discouraged, and even if you fail the first time, take it again until you can earn your red/black belt. We believe that all of our students CAN get belts. It's just a matter of time and perseverance, and again, many of our most successful black belt alumni/students have failed the exam the first time they took it.
Make sure you revisit the SQL queries chapter. You'll have to know how to do JOIN statements as well as how to do SELF joins. Make sure you feel comfortable with complex SQL queries before you take the exam.

Make sure you understand how to pass parameters via URL (e.g. http://localhost/users/show/5).

Make sure you really understand how to do login and registration. You will most likely be asked to build a login/registration from scratch and also modify it slightly based on the wireframe provided.

After you complete the example, we strongly encourage that you talk to other members of your cohort to see how they've done the assignment. Seeing how others have done the sample exam would help you to see different ways of doing things and will help you to become a better developer.
