# Django is all about sharing!

Remaking an app over and over again to do the same task is tedious.  It's better to extend an app that is already made (either one that you've made, or one out there that someone else has made).  In general, if an app is from an outside source you integrate its models, using keys in your models.  Anyways here's a list of fun apps!
