# Courses!
Awesome now we've actually attached ourselves to our DB and are getting the basics of the ORM down...  Ok, I guess more seriously we've seen the ORM in action, now let's put into action!

Make a django project and application for the wireframe below.

We showed you the wireframe, and model code before, but let's throw on a few bonuses!

(THESE ARE OPTIONAL!)

1) Make description a one to one relationship with the course table, rather than a row in the course table (intermediate).

2) Add a button that allows you to add comments about the courses, and a page with those comments! (advanced)
