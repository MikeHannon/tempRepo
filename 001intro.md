MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is a way of organizing code to help create robust web applications. You can imagine that creating all of the Python code for a website like Facebook using the procedural techniques that we have learned could get pretty messy. By combining OOP with our knowledge of the different web components, we can organize our code to be more modular. An MVC framework helps us do just that.

Most *ALL* enterprise level web applications are built using an MVC framework, and it's *CRITICAL* that you understand how to build your web application using one. For our purposes, we'll be using **Django**, an extremely popular Python framework based on the MVC structure.

## Objectives:
+ Understand what the different components in an MVC framework are and how they interact
+ Understand the path of an HTTP request and how the response is generated and returned within the framework
+ Understand the difference between *procedural* code and *MVC* code and the advantages of both
+ Understand how OOP works in an MVC context
+ Build a website with MVC framework!
