MVC architecture is a way of organizing code to help create robust web applications. You can imagine that creating all of the Python code for a website like Facebook using the procedural techniques that we have learned could get pretty messy. By combining OOP with our knowledge of the different web components, we can organize our code to be more modular and we can use an MVC framework to help us.

Most ALL enterprise level web applications are built using an MVC framework and it's CRITICAL that you understand how to build your web application using an MVC framework.

## Objectives
Our objectives are for you to

- Understand what the different components in an MVC framework are and how they interact
- Understand the path that an HTTP request goes through in the framework and how the response is generated and returned.
- Understand the difference between Procedural code and MVC code and the advantages of both.
- Understand how OOP works in the MVC framework
- Build a website with MVC framework!
