# The next two assignments are just to really emphasize this process:

Create a new project called integration_project (or whatever you want to name it)

1) Add in 2 or 3 of your level one assignments, and give them discrete url paths in your project urls.py

2) Change the routing to named routing in each of them!

3) Make them work!

## Do the same with courses and login and registration, and make a new model in one of them that has a ForeignKey field to the other app!

In pictures: build this as an additional view for your courses!
