# The Real Views of Django

Ok remember - and I can't emphasize this enough!!!

The Django Models is the M in MVC.

The Dango views.py file is the CONTROLLER in MVC.

The Django templates folder is the VIEWS in MVC.


So if after this section is over, and someone asks you - are you familiar with MVC?  You will say yes!  -- And be able to explain to them the roll of each element of MVC... right???

Its good practice with Django to specify your app in your templates folder.
