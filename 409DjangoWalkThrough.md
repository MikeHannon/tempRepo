# Assignment: Doing The Walk Through, Time Required: 3 hrs
At this point, you should be feeling pretty comfortable with a fair amount of the core pieces of Django.  Great Work!  It might seem weird that we'd be pointing you at the Django Tutorial this late, but there are some great nuggets of info in here that you might otherwise miss if we'd have had you start with Django!

Some things to note:
### The tutorial does a few things differently:
Most importantly is that the apps are not in their own app folder, but rather at the same outer level as manage.py.  Obviously this is fine! Having them all held in their own folder keeps them a bit more organized, but can make file pathing a bit more challenging, something the Django authors of the tutorial were trying to mitigate.


Get started here and work your way through the tutorial - grab a partner and pair program it!
