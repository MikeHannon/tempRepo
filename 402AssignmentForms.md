# Assignment: MiniRegister time: 2-4 hrs
We've already done login and registration a few times, so doing it again might be unnecessarily tedious.  But we definitely want to be comfortable using forms and checking out Django documentation.

So... we are just going to make a registration form.  Rather than using the userManager strategy, try making validators and validations!

We haven't explained these, so this assignment might take a little longer than you expect, but its time to be able to dig into the primary documentation and figure stuff out!

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/instances/

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/validators/

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/forms/modelforms/

(We know this is a lot of stuff, but in short once you figure out validators, calling is_valid will run those validations for us!)

###Build the registration portion of the following
![login_reg](/login-reg.png "login")

print the validation errors!
