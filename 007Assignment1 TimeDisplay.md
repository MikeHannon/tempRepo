Create a Django project called `main`

Create a new app in the `apps` folder of your main Django project called `timedisplay` (don't forget to add it to your main project's `settings.py` file)

In `timedisplay`'s controller (`views.py`), create a method named `index`.

When you go to the url `localhost:8000` this should run the `index` method in your controller file, (`views.py`). Have that method render a template that displays the current date and time like the wireframe below:
